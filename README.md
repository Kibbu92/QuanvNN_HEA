To launch the QCNN network, launch the file “loss-qcnn.py.” 

Specifically, it contains 3 “for loops”:

1) (OPT) Which optimizer to use
2) (Nl) Number of layers
2) (KNL) Size of the kernel. 
   
Before running “loss-qcnn.py” set the above three paramenters and the code will automatically go and create a folder with the results. 
To graph the results in terms of Loss, Accuracy, Gradient, the Barren Plateau and the Variation of Parameters launch the file “Plot_Total.py”.
